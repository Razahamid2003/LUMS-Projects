    "# Problem Background: The Great Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Year: 3050**\n",
    "\n",
    "The world as we knew it has changed drastically. After decades of conflict, disease, and a relentless zombie apocalypse, the human race faces extinction. The relentless hordes of the undead have ravaged cities, reduced populations, and devastated the planet's ecosystems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a desperate bid for survival, the remaining factions of humanity have united to embark on a monumental journey to a new home: **Earth Junior**, a distant planet believed to be free from the scourge of the undead. \n",
    "\n",
    "As they prepare for this monumental journey, the survival of the human race hinges on their ability to screen potential passengers at the spaceship station. It is crucial that no zombies are allowed to enter the spacecraft, as even a single infected individual could jeopardize the entire mission and the future of humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dire situation, you find yourself as the last surviving machine learning engineer, tasked with developing a screening model to predict the zombie-ness of a person. A high human-zombie score would mean the person is likely to be a zombie. The fate of the human race depends on your expertise in machine learning, and you must create a reliable system to ensure the success of this migration to 'Earth Junior'.\n"

    "# Human-Zombie Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset simulates human and zombie characteristics based on various lifestyle and physical traits. The dataset contains 1,000 entries, each with features that correlate with a continuous \"Human-Zombie Score\" ranging from 0 (complete human) to 100 (complete zombie).\n",
    "\n",
    "This generation of human race has smart-chips embedded in their bloodstream that can keep track of and record all these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Height (cm):** The height of the individual measured in centimeters, it decreases with zombie score because zombies are known to shrink in height.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight (kg):** The weight of the individual measured in kilograms. Zombies tend to have a lower weight because of loss of muscle mass, tissue, organs (and soul??).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Screen Time (hrs):** The average number of hours spent in front of screens daily. This feature increases with the human-zombie score, reflecting a more sedentary lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Junk Food (days/week):** The average number of days per week the individual consumes junk food. This feature also increases with the human-zombie score, indicating poorer dietary habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physical Activity (hrs/week):** The total hours spent on physical activities per week. This feature decreases as the human-zombie score increases, suggesting a decline in physical activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task Completion (scale):** Scale from 0 to 10 representing how often tasks are completed on time (0 = always on time, 10 = never on time). This score decreases with a higher human-zombie score, indicating declining productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human-Zombie Score:** A continuous score from 0 to 100 representing the degree of \"zombie-ness\" of the individual, where 0 is fully human and 100 is completely zombie-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",

    "In this part, you will implement multivariate linear regression (from scratch) to predict the the human-zombie score during screening before the person can be allowed to enter the spaceship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you have the human-zombie-datset.csv containing 1000 examples of the features described above and their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of these input features is stored using a different scale. The features include ranges 0-10, 17-100 and some between 130-200.  This is often the case with real-world data, and understanding how to explore and clean such data is an important skill to develop.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Subtract the mean value of each feature from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After subtracting the mean, additionally scale (divide) the feature values by their respective standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We only use examples of the train set to estimate the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to follow exactly the same steps as above i.e. implement hypothesis, cost function and gradient descent for multivariate linear regression to learn parameters $\\theta$ using train set. Finally, report the cost (error) using your learned parameters $\\theta$ on test set.\n",

    "\n",
    "A very subtle and important point to note here is that the mean and standard deviation should be calculated only on the training set, and then applied to the test set. This is because in real-world scenarios, we do not have access to the test set, and hence we cannot calculate the mean and standard deviation of the test set."
