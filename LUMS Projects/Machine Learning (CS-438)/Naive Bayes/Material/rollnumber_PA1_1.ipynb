    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be implementing two types of Naive Bayes model based on the dataset features and task requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference and additional details, please go through [Chapter 4](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) of the SLP3 book.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are provided with two datasets. One is suitable for **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, while the other is appropriate for **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**. Your task is to:\n",
    "1. Analyze both datasets and determine which Naive Bayes model to apply based on the dataset’s characteristics.\n",
    "2. Implement both **Multinomial** and **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** from scratch, adhering to the guidelines below regarding allowed libraries.\n",
    "3. Finally, apply the corresponding models using the `sklearn` library and compare the results with your own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines:\n",
    "- Use only **numpy** and **pandas** for the manual implementation of Naive Bayes classifiers. No other libraries should be used for this part.\n",

    "- **Dataset 2**: Tweet Evaluation Dataset (to be loaded from Hugging Face)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Golf Dataset**: You can find the CSV file of the Golf Dataset in the resources provided with this assignment. This dataset aims to explore factors that influence the decision to play golf, which could be valuable for predictive modeling tasks. ​​\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tweet Evaluation Dataset**: Instead of downloading the dataset manually, we will be using the [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets) library from Hugging Face to automatically download and manage the Tweet Eval dataset. This library is part of the Hugging Face ecosystem, widely used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The `datasets` library not only downloads the dataset but also offers a standardized interface for accessing and handling the data, making it compatible with other popular libraries like Pandas and PyTorch. Format each split of the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should be `text` and `label`, where `text` is the sentence and `label` is the emotion label. The goal is to classify tweets into various emotional categories (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) by analyzing their content.\n",

    "### Why Use Hugging Face?\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarizing yourself with Hugging Face tools now will be beneficial for future assignments and projects, where we will be relying on this platform for various NLP-related tasks. It simplifies data handling and ensures smooth integration with machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore both datasets and identify their key features. This will help you determine which dataset is best suited for **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and which is better suited for **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**. You can read more about Bernoulli Naive Bayes [here](https://medium.com/@gridflowai/part-2-dive-into-bernoulli-naive-bayes-d0cbcbabb775).\n"

    "## 3.1 Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model is based on **Bayes' Theorem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y \\mid x) = \\frac{P(x \\mid y)P(y)}{P(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want is to find the class \\(c\\) that maximizes \\(P(c \\mid x)\\), so we can use the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{c} = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ P(c \\mid x) = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ P(x \\mid c)P(c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**, we assume that each word \\(x_i\\) in a sentence follows a **Bernoulli distribution**, meaning that the word either appears (1) or does not appear (0) in the document. We can simplify the formula using this assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{c} = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ P(c) \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i = 1 \\mid c)^{x_i} P(x_i = 0 \\mid c)^{1 - x_i}\n",

    "- $x_i = 0$ if the $i^{\\text{th}}$ word is not present in the document.\n",
    "\n",

    "We can estimate $P(c)$ by counting the number of times each class appears in our training data, and dividing by the total number of training examples.

    "\n",
    "### **Important: Laplace Smoothing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating $P(x_i = 1 \\mid c)$ and $P(x_i = 0 \\mid c)$, we apply **Laplace smoothing** to avoid zero probabilities. This is essential because, without it, any word that has not appeared in a document of class $c$ will have a probability of zero, which would make the overall product zero, leading to incorrect classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Laplace smoothing ensures that we don't encounter zero probabilities by adding a small constant (typically 1) to both the numerator and the denominator. This is particularly useful when a word has never appeared in the training data for a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smoothed probability formula is:\n",
    "\n",

    "P(x_i = 1 \\mid c) = \\frac{\\text{count of documents in class } c \\text{ where } x_i = 1 + 1}{\\text{total documents in class } c + 2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures no word has a zero probability, even if it was unseen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding Underflow with Logarithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid underflow errors due to multiplying small probabilities, we apply logarithms, which convert the product into a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{c} = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ \\log P(c) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ x_i \\log P(x_i = 1 \\mid c) + (1 - x_i) \\log P(x_i = 0 \\mid c) \\right]\n",
